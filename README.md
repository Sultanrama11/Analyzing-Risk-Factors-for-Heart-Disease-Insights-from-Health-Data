# Heart Disease Risk Analysis

Author: Ahmad Sultan Ramadhan

# Overview
This project aims to analyze key risk factors associated with heart disease using health data. By applying data analysis techniques and machine learning models, it offers insights that can help inform public health policies and preventive strategies.

# Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Used Python and Pandas to prepare the data for analysis and modeling.
Data Visualization: Created clear visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight patterns and distributions.
Predictive Modeling: Built a Logistic Regression model with Scikit-Learn, achieving 92% accuracy.
Key Insights: Identified relationships between physical activity, smoking, diabetes, and heart disease risk.

# Key Insights
Smoking history and lack of exercise are associated with a higher risk of heart disease.
Regular physical activity reduces heart disease risk.
Diabetes and arthritis often co-occur with heart disease.
Individuals aged 50 and above are at higher risk, although smoking is also a concern among younger individuals.

# Tools and Libraries
Python & Pandas – For data cleaning and transformation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – For visualizing data
Scikit-Learn – For building a Logistic Regression model
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:
Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction Dataset

# Model Performance
Accuracy: 92%
Confusion Matrix:
No Disease - No Disease: 56,774 correct predictions
Disease - Disease: 4,997 correct predictions

# Visualizations
This project provides several key visualizations:

Heart disease distribution based on BMI
Relationship between physical activity and heart disease
Proportion of heart disease cases among smokers
# Recommendations
I
nsights from this project suggest the following actions:

Smoking cessation and promotion of active lifestyles
Education on diabetes management and its link to heart health
Regular exercise programs for disease prevention
Early detection through screening for at-risk groups (e.g., older adults or individuals with diabetes)
